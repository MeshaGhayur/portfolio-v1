            <h2 class="title">Marketo Newsletter</h2>
            <p>I completed this project while working at PC Travel. This newslettter template was created from scratch using HTML and CSS and is compatable with Marketo's customizable module functionality. There were two main reasons behind this project. 1. to make PC Travel newsletters responsive. 2. to make the email design process faster for the team members involved.</p>
            <p>For this, I followed a design created by the head designer and used it to code over 10 independent modules that can be used in conjuction with others to create custom templates within minutes. Additionally, I took the initiative to collaborate with the email designers to add customizability throughout the templates depending on their needs. For example, the ability to add or remove spacing between text, changing background colours and controlling mobile styles.</p>
            <p>The result of this upgrade in functionality and hardcoded consistency for main level elements meant that the designers were able to build emails within 10-15 minutes, a major improvement from 30-60 minutes.</p>
